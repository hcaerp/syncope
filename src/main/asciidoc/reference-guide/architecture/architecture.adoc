== Architecture

Apache Syncope is made of several components, which are logically summarized in the picture below.

[[admin-console-component]]
=== Admin UI

The Admin UI is the web-based console for configuring and administering running deployments, with full support
for delegated administration.

The communication between Admin UI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

More details are available in the dedicated <<admin-console,usage>> section.

[[admin-console-accessibility]]
==== Accessibility

The Admin Console UI is accessible to the visually impaired.

Two icons are present in the main login page and in the menu on the right:

[.text-center]
image::accessibility-console01.png[title="Admin Console accessibility buttons",alt="Admin Console accessibility buttons"]

By clicking the top right corner icon image:accessibility-icon01.png[Accessibility HC mode,30,30] it is possible to 
toggle the "High contrast mode".
In this mode, the website colors are switched to a higher contrast color schema.

[TIP]
====
The `H` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey[accesskey^] shortcut can
be used to easily toggle "High contrast mode" by using the keyboard.

E.g. 
|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|`Alt` + `Shift` + `H`
|Toggle "High contrast mode" on Firefox and Chrome browsers on Linux
|===

====

By clicking the second icon image:accessibility-icon02.png[Accessibility Increased Font mode,30,30] it is possible 
to toggle the "Increased font mode".
In this mode, the website font size is increased.

[TIP]
====
The `F` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey[accesskey^] shortcut can
be used to easily toggle "Increased font mode" by using the keyboard.

E.g. 
|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|`Alt` + `Shift` + `F`
|Toggle "Increased font mode" on Firefox and Chrome browsers on Linux
|===

====

To reset to the default mode, it is enough to click again on the specific icon.

[[enduser-component]]
=== End-user UI

The End-user UI is the web-based application for self-registration, self-service and <<password-reset,password reset>>.

The communication between End-user UI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

[[enduser-accessibility]]
==== Accessibility

The End-user UI is accessible to the visually impaired.

Two icons are present in the main page, in the right corner:

[.text-center]
image::accessibility-enduser01.png[title="Enduser accessibility icons",alt="Enduser accessibility icons"]

By clicking the top right corner icon image:accessibility-icon01.png[Accessibility HC mode,30,30] it is possible to 
toggle the "High contrast mode".
In this mode, the website colors are switched to a higher contrast color schema.

[[cli-component]]
=== CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) client is an utility tool meant for interacting with Apache Syncope deployments from 
shell scripts.

The communication between CLI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

More details are available in the dedicated <<cli,usage>> section.

=== Third Party Applications

Third-party applications are provided full access to IdM services by leveraging the REST interface, either via the 
Java <<client-library,Client Library>> (the basis of Admin UI, End-user UI and CLI) or plain HTTP calls.

==== Eclipse IDE Plugin

The Eclipse IDE plugin allows remote management of <<notification-templates,notification e-mail>> and
<<report-templates,report>> templates, and constitutes an example of a Java application relying on the Client Library
for interacting with the Core via REST.

==== Netbeans IDE Plugin

The Netbeans IDE plugin allows remote management of <<notification-templates,notification e-mail>> and
<<report-templates,report>> templates, and remote editing of Apache Groovy <<implementations,implementations>>. +
It constitutes an example of a Java application relying on the Client Library for interacting with the Core via REST.
